                            ever. His talents allowed him to gain a close relationship with designer Alfredo Barraza and
                            participate in beauty pageants as a stylist for the participants. <b>Then in 1987</b>,
                            Fernando became
                            the first ever gay beauty pageant queen.

                            most impoverished departments. Mendoza's father died of diabetes as a result

                            she became the first black woman to be crowned Miss Colombia

                            was a thing of the past.

                            Very little is known about Abréu’s early life except that her parents are
                            from Medellin, Colombia, so her story starts in her education. She has a
                            degree in <b>Social Communication</b> with a focus on Digital Marketing from EAFIT
                            (Escuela de Administración, Finanzas e Instituto Tecnológico) University.
                            The last Miss Colombia winner from the department of Antioquia was in 1996,
                            so her crowning as <b>Miss Colombia 2024</b> was a triumph for Antioquia.

                            Catalina Duque Abréu has worked with <b>multiple organizations</b>, such as child
                            development, the fight against cancer, entrepreneurship, and female empowerment,
                            and has fought for equality. She hopes to become a university professor one day!
                            Abréu once again shows that Colombian women are <b>not just a pretty face and body</b>,
                            but they are <b>intelligent and hardworking</b>.
