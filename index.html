                <h3> About Us</h3>
                <p>For the Capstone Project, we have decided to create a website. This website will be created to answer
                    the question, “How does Colombia see itself?” We will explore this topic through the lens of the
                    arts. We will include three different arts: music, theatre, and beauty pageants. The music webpage
                    will function as a spotlight on Colombian artists who have influenced Colombia’s music scene and
                    culture. The theatre webpage will function as a glance at the performing arts landscape in Colombia,
                    with a spotlight on trending and famous shows, actual theaters, and important figures. The beauty
                    pageantry
                    webpage will function as a connection between beauty, culture, and opportunity as seen associated
                    with beauty pageants in Colombia, diving into the connections that winning a beauty pageant title
                    can bring. This website will feel similar to a ‘Visit Colombia’ website, but with a more authentic,
                    human feel—rather than a commercial, touristy advertisement. The main goal is to look beyond the
                    violence that Colombia has experienced for years. Furthermore, we are looking to change the viewers’
                    perspective on Colombia—a nation defined by its reputation, drugs, violence, and coffee—but to look
                    beyond it and let Colombia define itself. </p>
